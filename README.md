Repo thats useful for analysing mouse behaviour data

Depends on source of behaviour data
- type of behaviour (e.g. Morris watermaze, Fear Conditioning)
- type of behaviour tracking software (e.g. Actimetrics)

R code dependencies
- ggplot2
- plyr
- reshape2

### Note

This is under development and has much incomplete or absent from the code currently. Likely not helpful to anyone until more functionality is added/completed. Feel free to contribute/suggest.
